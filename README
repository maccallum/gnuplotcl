gnuplotcl is a Common Lisp wrapper for gnuplot.  

---Loading the gnuplot package:

To load using ASDF, do

	(asdf:load-system 'gnuplot)
	(use-package 'gnuplot)

If you don't like ASDF, just compile package.lisp, then gnuplot.lisp.

---Plotting values;

	(plot '(0 1 2)) ; y values only
	(plot '(0 1 2) (3 4 5)) ; x and y values
	(plot '(0 1 2) (3 4 5)) "with lines")) ; x and y values with a formatting command
	(plot '(0 1 2) "with lines")) ; y values with a formatting command
	(plot '(0 1 2) (3 4 5) "with lines" (0 1 2) (3 4 5) "with impulses") ; 2 plots"

The lplot form is similar to plot except that all arguments are passed as a list of lists.

---Sending commands to the gnuplot process:

	(gp-command (format nil "set xtics (窿蕃)" (arithm-seq 100 :step 2)))
	(gp-command "set xlabel \"Time (sec.)\"")
	(gp-command "set xrange [0 : 100]")

---Starting, restarting and quitting the gnuplot process:

	(start-gp)
	(restart-gp)
	(quit-gp)

---Setting the term type and output file:

	(gp-set-term-type <termtype>)
	(gp-set-output-file <outputfilename>)

Must be one of the symbols in *gp-term-commands*: x11, eps, eps-tabloid-landscape, or png. You can, of course, just add more commands to that variable.

---Querying the state of the gnuplot process:

	(is-gp-running?)
	(gp-get-term-type)
